## Current State

**The Problem Alexa Identified**:
- Built massive infrastructure (1000 agents, 15 orgs, 19 domains, custom hardware)
- Zero users, zero revenue, zero validation
- Using complexity as protection from shipping
- Every AI conversation resets - wastes time re-contextualizing

**The Real Issue**:
- Working 12 hours/day but feeling behind
- AI assistants don't maintain context between sessions
- Can't say "next" and continue where we left off

## COMMITTED: Context Bridge Launch - Friday Feb 14, 2026

**The Product**: "Stop re-explaining yourself to AI"
- Create structured context file for users
- Auto-hosted gist endpoint

**Ready to Build (But Ship First!):**
- [ ] Version History Viewer (Phase 4)
- [ ] AI Suggestions (Phase 5)
- [ ] Team Features (Phase 6)
- [ ] Integrations (Phase 7)

**For AI Continuity**:
- This file should be read FIRST in every conversation
- Update this file at the END of each session with:
  - What was completed
  - What's next
  - Current blockers
  - Active decisions

## Active Decisions MADE ✅

- ✅ What ONE product ships this month? **Context Bridge**
- ✅ Who is the target user? **Anyone using AI assistants for multi-session work**
- ✅ What's the minimal thing they'd pay $10 for? **Stop wasting 10 min re-explaining context every conversation**

## Context for Next Session

**If Alexa mentions**:
- "Cece" - Another AI agent persona they work with
- "Memory system" - PS-SHA-infinity journals, multi-agent coordination
- "The scripts" - Now all on GitHub (766 files committed today)
- "The cathedral" - Metaphor for building perfect infrastructure instead of shipping

**Key Repos**:
- Main scripts: `github.com/blackboxprogramming/blackroad-scripts`
- Registry: `infra/blackroad_registry.json` (24 services)
- Services: `services/` directory (Next.js 14 apps)

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't suggest more infrastructure
- Don't build more systems
- Don't add complexity
- Focus on: What can ship to ONE real user THIS WEEK?

**Instructions for Claude Sessions**:
READ THIS FILE FIRST. Check GitHub if needed. Don't ask Alexa to repeat context that's here.
